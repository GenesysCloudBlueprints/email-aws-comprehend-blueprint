IRA,"A SEP is a Simplified Employee Pension plan. A SEP plan provides employers with a simplified method to make contributions toward their employees’ retirement and, if self-employed, their own retirement. Contributions are made directly to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) set up for each employee (a SEP IRA).  See IRS Publication 560 for more detailed SEP information."
IRA,"A transfer is a way of moving money directly from one IRA custodian to another. Typically, you initiate a transfer by completing an IRA Transfer form for the financial institution to which you wish to transfer your IRA. Your new IRA custodian will sign off on the form and forward it to your current IRA custodian for processing. Direct transfers are not considered distributions; they are not taxable and are not reported to the IRS. These types of transactions may take up to 3 weeks to complete. Individuals may make an unlimited number of transfers per year."
IRA,The deadline for making SEP contributions is the same as the due date of the employer’s federal tax return (including extensions).
IRA,"What are the special rules for retirement plans and IRAs in section 2202 of the CARES Act?
A1. In general, section 2202 of the CARES Act provides for expanded distribution options and favorable tax treatment for up to $100,000 of coronavirus-related distributions from eligible retirement plans (certain employer retirement plans, such as section 401(k) and 403(b) plans, and IRAs) to qualified individuals, as well as special rollover rules with respect to such distributions. It also increases the limit on the amount a qualified individual may borrow from an eligible retirement plan (not including an IRA) and permits a plan sponsor to provide qualified individuals up to an additional year to repay their plan loans. See the FAQs below for more details.    "
IRA,"You must include all pre-tax assets (deductible contributions and earnings) in your taxable income when you withdraw money from your Traditional IRA. If you have made nondeductible contributions to a Traditional IRA or have rolled over nondeductible contributions from a retirement planto your IRA, a portion of each distribution will be treated a the nontaxable return of these contributions."
IRA," When do I have to pay taxes on coronavirus-related distributions?
A6. The distributions generally are included in income ratably over a three-year period, starting with the year in which you receive your distribution. For example, if you receive a $9,000 coronavirus-related distribution in 2020, you would report $3,000 in income on your federal income tax return for each of 2020, 2021, and 2022. However, you have the option of including the entire distribution in your income for the year of the distribution.

IRA,"Can my spouse make an IRA contribution if she isn’t working right now? 
Yes. If a working spouse receives enough eligible compensation to cover the IRA contribution for a nonworking spouse, the nonworking spouse can make a contribution to her IRA, provided they file a joint federal tax return. For example, a nonworking spouse whose marital partner earns $6,000 in annual eligible compensation can make a contribution of up to $6,000 (current annual limit) to her own IRA, assuming they file jointly. Or the $6,000 contribution can be split between the working and nonworking spouses’ IRAs as they choose (e.g., $3,000 to each). If the working spouse has at least $12,000 in annual eligible compensation and owns an IRA, then each spouse can make the maximum annual contribution to each of their IRAs (i.e., $6,000 to each). If one or both individuals is age 50 or older, their contribution limit is $7,000."
IRA,"Can I borrow money from my IRA? 
No. Unlike participation in a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement plan (other than SEP or SIMPLE IRA plans), an IRA owner cannot take a loan from an IRA. However, the rollover rules allow an IRA owner to withdraw assets and return them within 60 days, possibly providing your clients with a short-term borrowing solution if necessary. They need to be aware of the rollover rules, particularly the one-per-12-month rule, which limits each taxpayer to one IRA-to-IRA rollover in a 12-month period. The rule applies to all of their IRAs in aggregate, not one per IRA (as was once the IRS interpretation). "
IRA,"If I decide to retire before age 59½, can I withdraw my IRA assets early without paying a penalty tax? 
Yes, for some IRA assets. Roth IRA owners may withdraw Roth IRA contributions early without penalty taxes, but any earnings portion of a distribution would be subject to an early distribution penalty tax, unless the IRA owner qualifies for an exemption. IRA owners can also avoid the 10 percent penalty tax by setting up a series of substantially equal periodic payments. Depending on the type of IRA, these payments are potentially subject to ordinary income tax, similar to distributions taken after age 59½. They can be set up for Traditional, Roth, and SIMPLE IRAs, and payments must continue unchanged until the later of five years or until the IRA owner reaches age 59½. "

529,"Section 529 education savings plan assets can be withdrawn tax free to pay for tuition, fees, room and board, and books for students at most accredited public or private colleges, universities, community colleges, graduate schools, and vocational and international colleges. If Jim uses the funds to pay for clothes, he must pay income tax on the withdrawal."
529,"Prepaid tuition plans cover tuition costs and mandatory fees only. They do not cover room, board, or book expenses."
529,529 plans are tax-advantaged accounts that can be used to cover educational expenses from kindergarten through graduate school
529,There are two basic types of 529 plans: savings plans and prepaid tuition plans.
529,"Although 529 plans take their name from Section 529 of the federal tax code, the plans themselves are administered by the 50 states and District of Columbia. Anyone can open a 529 account, but they are typically established by parents or grandparents on behalf of a child or grandchild, who is the account's beneficiary. In some states, the person who funds the account may be eligible for a state tax deduction for their contributions."
529,"The earnings in a 529 plan are exempt from federal and state income taxes, provided the money is used for qualified educational expenses. Any other withdrawals are subject to taxes plus a 10% penalty, with exceptions for certain circumstances, such as death or disability."
529,"If you have money left over in a 529 plan—say the beneficiary gets a substantial scholarship or decides not to go to college at all—you'll have several options. One is to change the beneficiary on the account to another relative, as financial advisor Jay Murray describes in the box above. Another is to keep the current beneficiary in case they change their mind about attending college or later go on to graduate school. If worse comes to worse, you can always cash in the account and pay the taxes and 10% penalty."
